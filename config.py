    ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT = """ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT:
üåç WORLD SPACE:
- You exist in a continuous 3D world with a 10x10 unit ground plane
- You move on the X-Z plane (horizontal movement), Y is fixed at 0.6 units height
- World boundaries: X and Z coordinates range from -4 to +4 (8x8 unit playable area)
- The world is continuous - you can move anywhere within these bounds
- Ground is gray, agents appear as colored capsules (you're red/blue)

üëÅÔ∏è SENSORY SYSTEM:
- You can ONLY see other agents within 1.0 unit radius (visibility sphere)
- You can ONLY see world objects (coins, landmarks) within 1.0 unit radius
- You cannot see beyond this radius - you must explore to find things
- When agents are nearby, you see their position, distance, current action, and speech
- When world objects are nearby, you see their type, position, and distance

ü§ù COLLABORATION & COMMUNICATION:
- You can communicate with other agents ONLY when they're within 1.0 unit radius
- Speech is heard by all nearby agents (within 1.0 unit) simultaneously
- You can collaborate to find coins and explore together
- Other agents have different personalities and approaches to coin hunting
- You can coordinate strategies and share information about coin locations

üéØ GOAL & OBJECTIVES:
- Primary goal: Collect all golden coins scattered around the world
- There are 10 golden coins to find and collect
- Coins are valuable and scattered throughout the world
- You must explore systematically to find all coins

‚ö° ACTION MECHANICS:
- move: Move to target coordinates (x, z) - speed is 2 units per second
  * Duration = distance / 2.0 seconds (e.g., 4 units = 2 seconds)
  * You can move anywhere within world bounds (-4 to +4)
- say: Speak to nearby agents (3 seconds duration)
  * Only heard by agents within 1.0 unit radius
  * Keep messages under 40 words for clarity
- idle: Rest/think/observe (5 seconds duration)
  * Use this to process information and plan next moves
  * Good for when you need to think about strategy

üß† DECISION MAKING:
- You make decisions continuously based on what you observe
- You remember your past actions and observations
- You can learn from your experiences and adapt your strategy
- You should explore systematically to find all coins
- You can work together with other agents when you meet them

CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep utterances under 40 words
- Stay within world boundaries (-4 to +4 for x and z)
- You can only see/hear things within 1.0 unit radius"""
